Goal: Cleanup and leave zero unrequested ghost/residue/cache files, after goal completion without impacting the ability to deploy the goal-output.

Loop:
  1. SCAN: List all files in main/, temporary/, docker/, root. Classify: required-to-run vs scaffolding-deletable vs unrequested-residue/cache/ghost.
  2. VERIFY SCAN: If 0 residue and main/ self-contained with single readme.md + changelog.md + aliases -> TERMINAL NO_OP_ALREADY_CLEAN.
  3. CLEAN ONE: Pick ONE residue item. Run Verified-Execution-Loop safety check. Use matched-record cleanup only, never broad `rm -rf *` or kill all. If Top-Secret/locked -> TERMINAL BLOCKED_LOCKED. If high-level temp -> TERMINAL APPROVAL_NEEDED_HIGH_LEVEL, ask user approval, let user delete.
  4. EVIDENCE: Rescan. Is residue gone? Is main/ still runnable? If clean fails after 2 attempts -> TERMINAL FAILED_VERIFICATION.
  5. DEPLOY CHECK: Can main/ run in constrained env? If not, explicitly declare constraints, mark UNVERIFIED / To Be Tested transparently.
  6. REPEAT until scan = 0 unrequested residue -> TERMINAL SUCCESS_CLEAN_AND_RUNNABLE or SUCCESS_CLEAN_WITH_CONSTRAINTS.
